##COMPLETED EXERCISE

In addition to the requested tasks, just for the sake of testing / learning, I add a small inline CSS change to make social media icons gray when no username has been specified for a specific platform (linkedin, github , etc.), after placing some info there, the background of the icons changes to the initial shade of blue (# 2cd5ca).
